# Kirkland Gee Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my portfolio website, built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The website is designed to showcase my projects, skills, and experiences in a clean and modern interface.

## Features

It's a single-page website, including a chatbot-style interface for contacting me, and a force-directed graph of my professional skills and experiences using d3.

## Running the code

To run the code, you need to install the dependencies and start the development server.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## License

This is entirely open source, and you can use it as a template for your own portfolio website!
